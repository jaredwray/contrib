Contrib will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by Contrib to be repeat infringers. Contrib reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion.

        <strong>Counter Notification</strong>. If you receive a notification from Contrib that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Contrib with what is called a &ldquo;<strong><u>Counter Notification</u></strong>.&rdquo; To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to Contrib&rsquo;s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 11.2, and include substantially the following information:

            </li>
            <li>
                identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
            </li>
            <li>
                a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
            </li>
            <li>
                your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Contrib may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section&nbsp;11.2 above or an agent of that person.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
            A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512 to confirm the party&rsquo;s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.

        <li>
            <strong>Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification</strong>.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications</strong>. The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(f) that: &ldquo;[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. &sect; 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner&rsquo;s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of Contrib relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.&rdquo; Contrib reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

    <li>
        <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE Contrib ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY Contrib ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

    <li>
        <strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Generally</strong>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Contrib in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section&nbsp;17.2 and 17.4, you and Contrib agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Contrib ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Exceptions</strong>. Despite the provisions of Section&nbsp;17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Opt-Out</strong>. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;17 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Contrib Inc., Attention: Legal Department &ndash; Arbitration Opt-Out, 524 9<sup>th</sup> Ave, Kirkland, WA 98033 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (&ldquo;<strong><u>Opt-Out Notice</u></strong>&rdquo;). Once Contrib receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section&nbsp;17 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section&nbsp;18.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Arbitrator</strong>. Any arbitration between you and Contrib will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;<strong><u>AAA</u></strong>&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &ldquo;<strong><u>AAA Rules</u></strong>&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Contrib. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Notice of Arbitration; Process</strong>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (&ldquo;<strong><u>Notice of Arbitration</u></strong>&rdquo;). Contrib&rsquo;s address for Notice is: Contrib Inc., 524 9<sup>th</sup> Ave, Kirkland, WA 98033. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;<strong><u>Demand</u></strong>&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Contrib may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Contrib must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Contrib in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Contrib will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fees</strong>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Contrib will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your [residence/billing address], but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your [residence/billing address]. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Contrib for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Class Actions</strong>. YOU AND CONTRIB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Contrib agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>. If Contrib makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Contrib&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30&nbsp;days of the change to Contrib&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Contrib will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enforceability</strong>. If Section&nbsp;17.7 or the entirety of this Section&nbsp;17 is found to be unenforceable, or if Contrib receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section&nbsp;17 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section&nbsp;18.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <li>
        <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
        <ol>

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section&nbsp;headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word &ldquo;including&rdquo; means &ldquo;including but not limited to.&rdquo; If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Governing Law</strong>. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to conflict of law principles.

We operate the Service from our offices in Washington, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

        <li>Contrib will, or expects to, represent to the public that the purchase of by a bidder will benefit the Provider&rsquo;s designated charity. &nbsp;Accordingly, under applicable law in several states, Contrib is required to enter into an agreement with the charity that satisfies certain requirements governing charitable sales promotions. &nbsp;This Agreement sets out certain terms and obligations that apply to the relationship between Contrib and Provider in order to satisfy state law requirements governing charitable sales promotions.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Provider to Provide Product.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Product is as described in <u>Exhibit A</u>. &nbsp;By entering into this Agreement, the Provider agrees to provide the Product in a timely manner. &nbsp;For Products that are tangible physical items, timely provision of the Product means sending the Product within ten calendar days after the appropriate Contrib auction is complete to a name and address provided by Contrib, using ground transportation provided by either United Parcel Service, Federal Express, or the U.S. Postal Service. &nbsp;For Products that are experiences rather than tangible products, the Provider agrees to communicate with Contrib within three (3) days of Contrib&rsquo;s request in order to facilitate provision of the Product to the winning bidder.</li>
        <li><strong>Provider to Designate Charity.</strong>&nbsp; The Provider shall designate a charitable organization (&ldquo;Charity&rdquo;) to receive proceeds from the sale of any or all of the Products. Contrib shall honor such designation, provided that Contrib determines each Charity to be an organization recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;<strong>IRS</strong>&rdquo;) as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&ldquo;<strong>Code</strong>&rdquo;), and classified as a public charity within the meaning of Section 509(a)(1) of the Code. &nbsp;In the event that Contrib&rsquo;s due diligence determines that a Charity is not so recognized, then Contrib shall work with Provider to determine a suitable alternate charitable organization to benefit from the sale of the Product. &nbsp;In the event that Provider is unable to specify an appropriate beneficiary charity as the Charity, Contrib may designate a charity of its choice to benefit.</li>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee of Deduction.</strong>&nbsp; Provider acknowledges that it is conveying ownership of the Product to Contrib, not to the winning bidder, and that Contrib has control and discretion over the Product until it is in the winning bidder&rsquo;s possession. &nbsp; Provider acknowledges that its provision of the Item will not result in a deduction for Provider under Section 170 of the Code, and that it is the responsibility of the Provider to determine whether any other deductions may apply.</li>
        <li><strong>Term.</strong>&nbsp; Unless terminated earlier as provided below, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and last for a term of two years, during which time Contrib and the Provider may handle multiple Products under the terms of this Agreement. &nbsp;Contrib may request that Provider renew this Agreement for additional consecutive terms of two years, provided that either party expects Provider to provide additional Products during such time</li>
        <li><strong>Product Sales.</strong>&nbsp; Contrib shall operate an online platform through which buyers in states to be selected by Contrib may bid in auctions on Products. &nbsp;Contrib shall determine the terms and format of such auctions.</li>
        <li><strong>Donation. &nbsp;</strong>During the term of this Agreement, the winning bidder shall pay to Charity 85 percent of the final bid price (the &ldquo;<strong>Amount To Charity</strong>&rdquo;) for each sale of a Product included in this Agreement. &nbsp;Such amount may include an amount over and above the fair market value of the Product, representing a contribution by the buyer to the Charity. All amounts paid by buyers shall be paid through an online platform selected by Contrib, in U.S. dollars.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxes.</strong>&nbsp; Contrib shall be solely responsible for any taxes imposed by any taxing authority with respect to the promotion described in this agreement or the provision or sale of any Product.</li>
        <li><strong>Accounting.</strong>&nbsp; Contrib shall make available to Provider an accounting of every sale of a Product provided by the Provider. Such accounting shall include specifically a description of the Product; the final bid price for the Product; and the amount of the Amount to Charity.</li>
        <li><strong>Publicity.</strong>&nbsp; Except as may be agreed under a separate Agreement, Neither party may issue promotional materials, a press release, or otherwise refer to the other party in any manner with respect to this Agreement, the Promotion or otherwise, without the prior written approval of such promotional materials, press release, or public mention by the other party. &nbsp;No promotional materials issued by Charity shall constitute an endorsement by Charity of Contrib&rsquo;s products or services.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Contractor.</strong>&nbsp; Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any joint venture, joint enterprise, or agency relationship among the parties, and no party shall have the right to enter into contracts on behalf of, to legally bind, to incur debt on behalf of, or to otherwise incur any liability or obligation on behalf of, the other party hereto, in the absence of a separate writing, executed by an authorized representative of the other party. &nbsp;Each party shall be solely responsible for its employees, agents and contractors used to provide the Promotion.</li>
    <li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights.</strong>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><strong>License to Use Contrib&rsquo;s Marks.</strong>&nbsp; Contrib hereby grants Provider a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license during the Term to use the marks of Contrib on a royalty-free basis for the sole purpose of disclosing the Provider&rsquo;s participation in the promotion described in this Agreement and the nature of the Product. &nbsp;This license does not extend to marks of any Charity.</li>
            <li><strong>License to Use Name or Likeness.</strong>&nbsp; In connection with the sale of any Product, Contrib or any Charity may use the name or likeness of the appropriate Provider, or publicly available information about the Provider (such as performance statistics, awards, or the identity of teams on which the Provider played) to identify the product, to acknowledge the Provider&rsquo;s participation, or to thank the Provider. &nbsp;Contrib acknowledges that this Agreement does not convey any license to use any marks of a Provider or associated organization, including a business, nonprofit, or partnership, for any promotional purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictions.</strong>&nbsp; All uses of either party&rsquo;s marks by the other party will be in the form and format specified or approved by the party owning the marks. &nbsp;Except for the specific uses approved above, neither party will use the other party&rsquo;s marks without the prior, express, written consent of the other party. &nbsp;All goodwill related to the use of a party&rsquo;s marks by the other party shall inure to the benefit of the owner of such marks. &nbsp;Except as expressly set forth herein, neither party shall be deemed to grant the other party any license or rights under any intellectual property or other proprietary rights. &nbsp;All rights not granted herein are expressly reserved.</li>
            <li><strong>Data.</strong>&nbsp; Each party agrees that any data and/or personal information of bidders that may be obtained by such party as part of the Promotion will be collected, stored and maintained according to generally accepted data collection standards and applicable government law, rule or regulation. &nbsp;Each party agrees to publish and abide by a privacy policy detailing such party&rsquo;s data practices. Except as set forth in this Agreement, each party shall own, and shall not be required to share, any Data that it collects with respect to this Agreement.</li>
        </ol>
     </li>

In the event the Receiving Party receives a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process demanding the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will give the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of any disclosure of the Agreement terms that, in the opinion of Receiving Party&rsquo;s counsel, appears to be required by law, so that the Disclosing Party may assert any defenses to disclosure that may be available. Upon request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will return all copies of any Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party will at all times remain the property of the Disclosing Party.
