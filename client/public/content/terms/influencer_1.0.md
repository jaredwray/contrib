# **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

1.

## **Generally**. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Contrib in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 17.2 and 17.4, you and Contrib agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Contrib ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

2.

## **Exceptions**. Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

3.

## **Opt-Out**. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 17 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Contrib Inc., Attention: Legal Department โ Arbitration Opt-Out, [Company Postal Address] that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (&quot; **Opt-Out Notice**&quot;). Once Contrib receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 17 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 18.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

4.

## **Arbitrator**. Any arbitration between you and Contrib will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot; **AAA**&quot;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &quot; **AAA Rules**&quot;) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Contrib. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

5.

## **Notice of Arbitration; Process**. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (&quot; **Notice of Arbitration**&quot;). Contrib&#39;s address for Notice is: Contrib Inc., [Company Postal Address]. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot; **Demand**&quot;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Contrib may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Contrib must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Contrib in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Contrib will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.

6.

## **Fees**. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Contrib will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your [residence/billing address], but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your [residence/billing address]. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Contrib for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&#39;s ruling on the merits.

7.

## **No Class Actions**. YOU AND CONTRIB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Contrib agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

8.

## **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**. If Contrib makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Contrib&#39;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Contrib&#39;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Contrib will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

9.

## **Enforceability**. If Section 17.7 or the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, or if Contrib receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

7.
