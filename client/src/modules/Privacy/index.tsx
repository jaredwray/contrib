              We do not track users of the Service across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and do

              Information has been collected on the Service from persons under 13 years of age and without verifiable
              parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent
              or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years of age has obtained an account on the Service,
              then you may alert us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@contrib.org">help@contrib.org</a>&nbsp;and request that
